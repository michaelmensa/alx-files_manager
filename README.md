# 0x04 Files Manager

## Description

This project serves as a comprehensive summary of the back-end development trimester, focusing on authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination, and background processing.

The primary objective is to construct a straightforward platform for uploading and viewing files:

- User authentication via a token
- Listing all files
- Uploading a new file
- Changing permissions of a file
- Viewing a file
- Generating thumbnails for images

While guided step by step through the building process, developers have the flexibility to implement certain aspects as they see fit, including splitting functionalities into separate files, leveraging the "utils" folder for common functions.

Acknowledging the existence of similar services in real-life scenarios, this project is designed for learning purposes, aimed at assembling individual components to create a fully functional product.

## Resources

Please read or watch the following resources:

- Node.js getting started
- Process API documentation
- Express getting started
- Mocha documentation
- Nodemon documentation
- MongoDB
- Bull (background processing)
- Image thumbnail generation
- Mime-Types
- Redis

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, developers are expected to be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external references:

- Creating an API with Express
- User authentication methods
- Storing data in MongoDB
- Utilizing Redis for temporary data storage
- Setting up and utilizing a background worker

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Node.js (version 12.x.x)
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, located at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- All code should use the `.js` extension
- Code will be verified against linting rules using ESLint
